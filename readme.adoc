= Spring Cloud AWS S3 Sample Application

This application uses https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-aws/reference/html/#using-amazon-web-services[Spring Cloud for Amazon Web Services] to upload and download files from AWS S3 bucket.
As of release 2.0.0.M2 Spring Cloud AWS does not support https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/data-encryption-with-amazon-s3/[Server-side data encryption] with Amazon S3.

With Server-side data encryption as soon as your data reaches S3, it is encrypted and stored.
The keys used for encryption are managed by Amazon.
When you request your data again, Amazon S3 decrypts it as itâ€™s streamed back to you.

This sample application overcomes this Spring Cloud AWS limitation by using pre-configured AmazonS3 client bean to set the server-side encryption flag when uploading data.

=  Configuration

application.properties in resources folder has AWS S3 bucket configuration properties and location of source/destination folders to upload and download files to and from AWS S3 respectively.
